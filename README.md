# Neetcode-150-Problem-1

7/08/2025

## Thought Process
I understood it was a simple for loop to traverse through the string. I also knew that I would have to use the abs() function to be able to get the absolute value of two ASCII values

## Initial Solution
I created a variable sum, initializing it to equal 0. Then, I created a for loop where the sum variable would be added to through each iteration. I learned about the ords() function, which allowed me to get the ASCII values of each string letter. After the for loop was completed, I returned the variable sum.

Initial solution - 5 ms

Complexity - O(n)

## Final Solution
I simplified the code into one line and used the sum() function, adding all the absolute values of each ASCII value within a the range of the string s

Final solution - 0 ms

Complexity - O(n)

## Takeaways
I learned about the ords() function, allowing me to know convert string letters to their ASCII values
I learned about the structure needed to do for loops in one line code, optimizing time used for the program to run
